### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**: The last time I used my to-do list app was this morning! I was organising the usual chaos — making sure I didn’t forget my son’s school project deadline, adding reminders for a work presentation, and planning dinner. I was trying to balance personal and professional tasks, and the app really helps me keep track of everything. But honestly, as someone partially sighted, I do find some features tricky, especially if the font is too small or the contrast isn’t great. I rely on it a lot, though, so I work around the issues as much as I can.

**Response to follow-up -- elaborate on tricky features and workarounds**: Ah, sure! The biggest challenge for me is often the visual design. For example, if the app doesn’t allow me to adjust the font size or lacks bold, high-contrast text options, it can be hard to read, especially when I’m rushing. Some icons or buttons can also be too small or not clearly labelled, which makes navigation tricky. To work around it, I often rely on features like zooming in with my phone’s accessibility settings or using screen readers. However, these aren’t perfect; zooming can disrupt the layout, and the screen reader doesn’t always recognise everything correctly. It would make a massive difference if apps prioritised more customisable and accessible designs from the start.

**Observations**: low readability + lack of customisability + of labelling clarity impede navigation, current accessbility measures ineffective

*by 'item' I mean text, icons, buttons, etc.

### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**: One of my biggest frustrations would be when I’m trying to quickly add or edit a task, but the app isn’t very accessible. For example, there’s one I used where the ‘add task’ button was this tiny icon in the corner, and it didn’t work well with my screen reader. I had to squint or keep tapping everywhere to find it, which wasted so much time and added stress. It would be great if important functions like that were larger, more obvious, or maybe even supported voice commands.

**Observations**: readability issues waste time and cause unneccessary stress

### Q3: Ever lost track of an important task?
**Response**: Oh, absolutely, that’s happened before! A few months ago, I completely missed a doctor’s appointment for my son because I had saved it in the wrong category on the app and didn’t notice. The notification didn’t pop up either because I’d accidentally turned it off whilst fiddling with settings to make the text more readable. It was such a stressful day trying to reschedule everything and feeling like I’d let people down. That’s why I think clearer organisation and forgiving systems — like better notification options and easier mistake-proofing — would really help!

**Response to follow-up -- what is meant by 'wrong' category, what categories were available**: Ah, sure, I can explain. The app I was using had preset categories like ‘Work’, ‘Personal’, ‘Family’, and so on. You could also create your own, but the layout for assigning tasks to these categories wasn’t very intuitive—it was just small icons or dropdowns that weren’t very readable. On that particular day, I accidentally saved the doctor’s appointment under ‘Work’ instead of ‘Family’, and because I rely so much on filtering tasks by category to stay organised, it ended up getting overlooked. If the interface were clearer or had better labels, it would’ve been easier to spot and fix early on.

**Observations**: lack of readability and of clear confirmation mechanisms causes organisational slip-ups and stress, defeating purpose of the app

### Q4: Ever work with a mouse? How does that change how you interact with apps?

**Prior to this, discussed in the context of mobile apps. Response when asked if use desktop**: Yes, I do use a desktop computer sometimes, but not as often as my phone. When I’m at home, I might use it for more complicated tasks like creating detailed schedules or syncing my calendar across devices. On a desktop, I appreciate having a bigger screen, which makes everything much easier to see. However, I still run into some of the same difficulties, like poor contrast or small text that isn’t adjustable. If the app doesn’t scale properly or isn’t well-optimised for larger screens, it can feel just as tricky to navigate as on my phone. This is why accessibility consistency across devices is so important for me.

**Response**: Yes, I do sometimes work without a mouse — especially when I’ve got one hand occupied, like holding my toddler or a cup of tea! When that’s the case, I rely on keyboard shortcuts or touch gestures if it’s a touchscreen. Navigating with just the keyboard can be slower and trickier if the app doesn’t have good focus indicators or doesn’t allow easy tab navigation. Sometimes it feels like I’m “lost” in the interface and have to press a lot of keys just to find what I need. Apps that clearly highlight the active element or offer robust keyboard controls make a huge difference for accessibility.

**Observations**: poorly developed keyboard and touch gesture mechanisms waste time and cause unneccessary stress

### Q5: Ever used in bright sunlight? What was hard?
**Response**: Yes, I have, and oh, it’s definitely a challenge! The glare from sunlight makes low-contrast designs even harder to see. If the app uses a light colour scheme or small text, it becomes almost impossible to read without squinting or tilting my phone awkwardly. I’ve found myself either hunting for shady spots or maxing out the brightness on my phone, which drains the battery quickly. A dark mode with bold, high-contrast text would help so much in these situations. Have you noticed how some apps now offer automatic light-to-dark mode switching? Features like that would be brilliant for accessibility too!

**Observations**: lack of screen customisability makes navigation difficult and time-consuming

### Q6: If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**: If I could add any feature, I’d love a more intuitive voice command system. Something where I could quickly say, ‘Add a family event for Wednesday at 3pm’ or ‘Remind me to call Sarah tomorrow’ without needing to type or fumble through menus. It would save so much time, especially when my hands are full or when I’m on the move. Pairing that with a system that reads back tasks for confirmation would make it even better—kind of like having a personal assistant in my pocket. 

**Observations**: voice commands and confirmation simplify interactions, reduce anxiety, and save time

**Themes**: `voice I/O`, `SR compatibility`, `confirmation`

### Q7 (round-off): any other struggles/thoughts to share?
**Response**: Hmm, let me think... One other struggle I’ve had is when apps don’t sync properly across devices. It’s so frustrating when I update my tasks on my phone and then find the changes haven’t appeared on my desktop. That kind of inconsistency really disrupts my workflow, especially when I’m juggling multiple things. Also, sometimes notifications can be too intrusive—either they pop up too aggressively or they’re too subtle, and I overlook them. It would be amazing if we could customise notifications more, like choosing different alert styles or even prioritising tasks so we’re interrupted only for the really urgent stuff.

**Response to follow-up -- what sort of different alert styles might you find useful?**:
Oh, sure! I think being able to set different levels of urgency for notifications would be really helpful. For example, a high-priority task could trigger a loud sound or a persistent pop-up that stays until I action it, while lower-priority ones might just send a gentle vibration or a subtle banner. It would also be great if I could choose notification formats—like voice reminders for when I’m driving, or colour-coded alerts that make urgency more visually obvious. These kinds of options would really help me stay on top of things without feeling overwhelmed.

**Observations**: notification customisability would help prioritisation as well as make them less easily missed

### Q1: Last time using task manager?
**Response**: The last time I used my to-do app was earlier today, actually! I was planning my son’s birthday party—it’s coming up soon. I needed to organise the guest list, list out supplies to buy, and make sure I didn’t forget anything like sending invitations. It’s a lot to juggle, so the app really helps me keep track of everything in one place, especially since I can add reminders and deadlines. I rely on features like voice input and large text display because of my partial sight, so accessibility is quite important for me.

**Observations**: key concern is readability

**Themes**: `item size`, `voice I/O`

---

### Q2: Biggest frustration?
**Response**: One of my biggest frustrations is when apps don’t work well with screen readers. For example, if certain buttons or menus aren’t labelled properly, it becomes really hard to navigate. Once, I was trying to reschedule a task for a different day, but the calendar picker wasn’t compatible with my screen reader—it just kept saying ‘unlabelled button,’ which was very frustrating. It’s these kinds of accessibility oversights that make the experience harder than it needs to be.

**Response to follow-up -- Were you able to work around that, or were you unable to reschedule the task?**: I did manage to work around it eventually, but it took longer than it should have. I had to ask my husband to help me with it, which felt a bit inconvenient because I rely on the app to be something I can use independently. It wasn’t ideal, but we figured it out. That said, I’d love to see apps pay more attention to making all their features accessible for people like me—it would make such a big difference in moments like that!

**Observations**: SR incompatibility limits independence and wastes time

### Q3: Ever lost track of an important task? What happened?
**Response**: Yes, I have lost track of an important task a couple of times. One instance that comes to mind is when I forgot to prepare a form for a school event my daughter was involved in. I’d noted it in the app, but the reminder didn’t trigger because I’d accidentally set it for the wrong day. I don’t know if it was a user error or a glitch, but I missed the deadline and had to scramble to sort it out. I guess these situations highlight how crucial reliable notifications are for me — they're one of the reasons I depend on these apps so much!

**Response to follow-up -- how did that make you feel?**: It made me feel quite stressed and disappointed, to be honest. Stressful because I had to rush to fix the situation, and disappointed because I really try to stay on top of things, especially when it comes to my kids. It also made me question the app’s reliability, which is frustrating when I depend on it so much. Moments like that remind me how much I value accuracy and dependable alerts in any task management tool.

**Observations**: lack of readability and of clear confirmation mechanisms causes organisational slip-ups and stress, defeating purpose of the app -- had there been a confirmation message specifying the date the task had been noted for, this could have been avoided

### Q4: Ever work with a mouse? How does that change how you interact with apps?
**Response to prior question on use of desktop computers**: I don’t use task managers on a desktop very often. My phone is just a lot more convenient since I’m always on the move and it’s easier to use with features like voice input. That said, on the rare occasions I do use a desktop, I’ve noticed some apps don’t have consistent accessibility options across devices, like missing shortcuts for screen readers. I think it’s important that functionality and accessibility are seamless whether you’re on mobile or desktop—it would give users like me more flexibility.

**Response**: I do sometimes work without a mouse on a desktop, especially when I’m using assistive tools like a keyboard with shortcut commands or my screen reader. When I’m navigating apps this way, I need everything to be keyboard-friendly, like using the Tab key to move between options or clear visual focus indicators. If an app doesn’t support that properly, it can slow me down or make certain features completely inaccessible, which is frustrating. Ensuring compatibility with keyboard-only input makes a big difference for people like me!

**Observations**: lack of keyboard mechanisms (or poorly developed ones) waste time and cause unneccessary stress

**Themes**: `SR compatibility`, `keyboard`

### Q5: Ever used in bright sunlight? What was hard?
**Response**: Yes, I’ve used a task manager in bright sunlight, and it can be quite challenging. The glare on the screen makes it hard to see small details, and if the app doesn't have strong contrast or adjustable font sizes, it becomes even worse. Features like dark mode or high-contrast modes are helpful, but they’re not always enough outdoors. I often rely on voice input in those situations, but even then, clear visibility is important for reviewing tasks. It can be quite an effort to stay productive in those conditions!

**Observations**: interface customisability allows for easier navigation under a range of conditions

**Themes**: `item size`, `contrast`, `light/dark theme`, `customisability`, `voice I/O`

### Q6: If you could add one feature to make task management less stressful, what would it be?
**Response**: If I could add one feature to make task management less stressful, it would be a customisable accessibility toolkit within the app. This feature could let users adjust text size, contrast levels, and even modify voice tones for voice input or output. It’d also include alerts that are impossible to miss, like vibration patterns alongside audio cues. Having that level of personalisation to suit my sight and hearing abilities would make managing tasks so much smoother, especially considering how diverse users' needs can be!

**Response to follow-up: so far mainly about partial sight, elaborate on hearing abilities?**: When it comes to my hearing abilities, I don’t have major impairments, but I do sometimes appreciate clearer, customisable audio cues. For instance, if reminders or notifications are too soft or high-pitched, I might miss them when there’s background noise at home or when I’m out and about. It’d be brilliant if apps let me adjust the tone and volume of alerts or even pair them with distinct vibrations—each task or reminder could have its own unique cue! Little touches like that would take a lot of stress out of managing tasks.

**Observations**: customisability reduces cognitive load by allowing users to adjust app output according to what makes most sense for them

**Themes**: `customisability`, `item size`, `contrast`, `notifications`, `vibration`, `sound`, `voice I/O`, `cognitive load`

### Q7 (round-off): any other struggles/thoughts to share?
**Response**: Another struggle I’ve faced is when apps assume everyone works the same way—like rigid structures for task organisation that don’t adapt to my preferred flow. It’d be amazing if apps allowed more freedom, such as creating sub-tasks within sub-tasks or organising tasks visually in ways that make sense personally. I also think apps could include a family sharing option for task lists, so everyone can coordinate better. Having features like these, on top of solid accessibility, would make them feel less stressful and more supportive for busy lives like mine!

**Observations**: increased flexibility in organisation can reduce cognitive load 

**Themes**: `cognitive load`

## Summary (Participant B)
**Top pain points**: (come down to the same points as with A)
1. Lack of interface readability, customisability, and confirmation mechanisms leads to organisational slip-ups and stress, as well as reduced independence
2. Lack of compatibility with SRs and keyboard shortcuts makes app use more time-consuming and stressful
