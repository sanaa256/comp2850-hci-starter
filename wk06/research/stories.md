# Job Stories — Week 6 Needs-Finding

---

## Story 1: Confirmation feedback
**Situation**: When I submit a form (add/edit/delete task)
**Motivation**: I want immediate, explicit, and informative confirmation that the action has succeeded
**Outcome**: So I can trust the interface without refreshing to verify
**Underlying need**: Because uncertainty about save status causes anxiety, organisational slip-ups, and inefficient workarounds. Informative rather than vague confirmations help me detect any mistakes (e.g. 'Task "Clean kitchen by 15:00" successfully added' rather than just 'Task successfully added').

## Story 2: Screenreader compatibility
**Situation**: When I'm navigating my tasks (reading/adding/editing/deleting/filtering/switching pages)
**Motivation**: I want the screen reader to clearly announce all the relevant information in a logical, followable order
**Outcome**: So I can navigate correctly and efficiently without making any mistakes
**Underlying need**: Clear screenreader output reduces anxiety over whether I am pressing the right buttons or entering text in the right place. It also helps me be more independent in my use of technology.

**Evidence**: Participant A (notes: lines 14, 25), Participant B (notes: lines 111, 113)
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, Screen reader
**Type**: Job story

## Story 3: Keyboard interface operability
**Situation**: When I'm navigating my tasks (reading/adding/editing/deleting/filtering/switching pages).
**Motivation**: I want to be able to easily perform these operations using a keyboard interface.
**Outcome**: So I can navigate the screen without a mouse or touchpad.
**Underlying need**: Because it enables me to use my screen reader. Also, pressing keys doesn't cause as much strain as a mouse and requires less precise movements.

**Evidence**: Participant A (notes: line 48), Participant B (notes: line 135), regarding motor issues: https://digitalcommunications.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2019/11/08/designing-for-users-with-physical-or-motor-disabilities/
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, Motor, Screen reader
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 2.1.1 Keyboard (A), 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (A)

## Story 4: High-contrast
**Situation**: When I'm navigating my tasks (reading/adding/editing/deleting/filtering/switching pages).
**Motivation**: I want the page elements (text, icons, etc.) to have a high enough contrast with the background.
**Outcome**: So I can clearly see them without squinting/coming too close to the screen.
**Underlying need**: Because excessive squinting and coming too close to the screen cause eye strain and distress. I could also misread/mistype something due to not being able to clearly see.

**Evidence**: Participant A (notes: lines 12, 14, 46), Participant B (notes: line 144)
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (AA)
